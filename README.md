# Trash-Terminal
> a lightweight terminal client made for handling files (thank you python)
> this version was specially designed for linux systems (working on a windows version dw)

# Setup
> how to setup trash is pretty simple. a lot, if not most of linux distros support python with it directly pre-installed in the system. (Windows Subsystem for Linux, or WSL, works too if you need to try it out on windows)
> # Command
  > open a terminal session
  > run the following command: `python3 main.py` (in whatever directory the file ended, i suppose)

# About the source code
> do whatever you want with the source code. i mainly put it here for a reason anyways.
> dont expect good quality from this app... i mainly made it for bs and curing boredom
